At the moment, this project only supports Genshin Impact set to the English language and running on a PC. It's also currently being worked on, so expect things to break often.

## Usage
1. Enter the wish screen in Genshin Impact (default keybind: `F3`)
2. Select History at the bottom (located next to Details). You should see a 6x3 table with your most recent wishes.
3. Navigate with the arrows at the bottom until you see your most recent 5-star character or weapon. Alternatively, go to your first few wishes if you have yet to pull a 5-star in that banner.
4. Copy everything by pressing `Ctrl+A` followed by `Ctrl+C`
5. Paste the text into the calculator, selecting your server region. Click â–¶ to view results.

## Installation
Should work right out of the box. Download Chart.js and edit [index.html](index.html) accordingly if you don't like CDNs.
